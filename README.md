üìå Project Overview

The proposed project presents a non-electric solar tracking system, which improves the efficiency of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels without the need to use motors, controllers, and external electricity. Rather it operates Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) materials and straightforward mechanical designs to trace the location of the Sun in the course of each day.

In contrast with the conventional systems of solar trackers, which require the use of electrical elements and additional energy, the system is based solely on thermo-mechanical principles, and thus it is environmentally friendly, economic, and extremely stable in the countryside and off-the-grid systems.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

1.Non-Electric Mechanism ‚Äì No motors, sensors, or electronic circuits.

2.Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) Actuation- SMA rods can grow/shrink with solar heat, giving automatic tracking.

3.Cost-Effective & Low Maintenance ‚Äì No need for external power or frequent servicing.

4.Sturdier and Scalable ‚Äì It can be used on panels that are small enough to work in a residential house or those that are large enough to operate in a solar farm.

5.Eco-Friendly -Saves energy without incurring power consumption.

üõ†Ô∏è Working Principle

1.SMA rods absorb solar heat.

2.Thermal expansion/contraction of SMA drives a ball joint + counterweight system.

3.The panel continuously aligns with the Sun‚Äôs position.

4.Energy absorption increases by reducing misalignment losses.

üìà Advantages

1.Increases energy capture by up to 25% compared to fixed panels.

2.Works independently of electricity.

3.Suitable for remote and rural areas where powered trackers are impractical.

4.Provides a sustainable and innovative alternative to traditional tracking systems.
