üìå Project Overview

The project presents a non-electric solar tracking system, which maximizes the efficiency of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels without depending on motor, controllers, and external electricity. Rather, it employs Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) materials and uncomplicated mechanical setups in order to monitor the location of the Sun on a daily basis.

Contrasting with old-fashioned solar trackers that need electricity and supplementary energy, the system itself is environment-friendly, affordable, and very dependable in off-grid settings and rural areas, as it and its functioning rely solely on thermodynamic and mechanical principles.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

1.Non-Electric Mechanism ‚Äì No motors, sensors, or electronic circuits.

2.Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) Actuation SMA rods are solar-heated to expand/contract, which offers automatic tracking.

3.Cost-Effective & Low Maintenance ‚Äì No need for external power or frequent servicing.

4.Scalable, Long lasting - Can be styled to small household panels or to large solar farms.

5.Eco-Friendly -Saves the energy loss without the inclusion of power consumption.

üõ†Ô∏è Working Principle

1.SMA rods absorb solar heat.

2.SMA thermal expansion/contraction is used to operate a ball joint + counterweight system.

3.The panel keeps on aligning with the position of the Sun.

4.The absorption of energy is maximized through minimization of misalignment losses.

üìà Advantages

1.Captures up to 25 % more energy as compared to fixed panels.

2.Works independently of electricity.

3.Applicable in remote and rural locations where trackers with power sources cannot be used.

4.Gives an alternative to conventional tracking systems that are sustainable and innovative.
